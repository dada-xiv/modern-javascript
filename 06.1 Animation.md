# Animation

Because browsers run JavaScript on the main thread, that endless loop will lock up the browser, including the animation. Instead, we must let the browser breathe, by periodically giving it control for short amounts of time.

One way to let the browser breathe is with either 'window.setInterval()' or 'window.setTimeout()'. The setTimeout() and setInterval() methods suffice for many purposes. They are general-purpose methods that let applications run some code at an approximate time in the future, but they are not precise timing mechanisms for animation. The fundamental problem with window.setInterval() and window.setTimeout() is that they are at the wrong level of abstraction.

The preferred way to implement the animation loop is with a W3C standard method named 'requestAnimationFrame()'. A typical procedure is as follows:
```javascript
function animate(time) {
    // Update and draw animation objects
    requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Sustain the animation
}
...
requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Start the animation
```
To start an animation, we invoke requestAnimationFrame(), passing a reference to a function that the browser calls when it’s time to draw the first animation frame. Typically, inside that function we will conditionally invoke requestAnimationFrame() again to keep the animation loop running. Notice that unlike window.setTimeout() and window.setInterval(), requestAnimationFrame() does not let us specify a frame rate; instead, the browser selects the optimal frame rate.

> Animations are typically time based, so requestAnimationFrame() passes the time—as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970—to our animation function.

To cancel a given callback that we have previously registered with requestAnimationFrame(), we can use 'cancelRequestAnimationFrame()'. It returns a long object that serves as a handle to the callback. Subsequently, we can pass that handle to cancelRequestAnimationFrame() to cancel the callback. We must call this method before the browser invokes our callback.
