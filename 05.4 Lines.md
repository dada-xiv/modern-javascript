# Lines

The Canvas context provides two methods for linear paths or a line,

* **moveTo(x, y)**: Adds a new subpath to the current path with the point we specify as the only point in that subpath. It does not clear any subpaths from the current path.

* **lineTo(x, y)**: If there are no subpaths in the current path, this method creates a new subpath with the point that we specify. If there are subpaths in the current path, it adds the point we specify to that subpath.

Note that if we draw a one-pixel-wide line on a pixel boundary, the line will actually be
two pixels wide. Because it is not possible to draw one half of a pixel, so that line extends to one pixel in each direction.

## Drawing dashed lines

To draw dashed lines on a canvas in JavaScript, we can make use of the setLineDash() method of the canvas context:
```javascript
let canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Set the line dash pattern
context.setLineDash([5, 3]); // [dashLength, gapLength]

// Draw a dashed line
context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(50, 50);
context.lineTo(250, 50);
context.stroke();
```

## Line caps 

Line caps are controlled by the 'lineCap' property of the Canvas context:
* **butt** is the default value of the lineCap property which leaves the end of the line untouched.
* **round** adds a semicircle to the end of the line with a diameter equal to one half the width of the line. 
* **square** adds a rectangle to the end of the line whose length is equal to the line width and
whose width is half of the line width.

## Line joins

Line joins are controlled by the 'lineJoin' property: 
* **miter** is the default value which adds an extra triangle to square the corner. 
* **bevel** results in a triangle connecting the opposite corners of the two lines with a straight line.
* **round** results in a filled arc connecting the two corners.

When we use miter for line joins, we can also specify a miterLimit property, which is a ratio of miter length divided by one-half of the line width. The miter length can get pretty long if the angle between two lines is small enough. If the miter length is long enough that the ratio of (miter length / Â½ of the line width) is greater than the value we specify for the miterLimit property, the browser treats the line join as if it were a bevel. The default value of miterLimit is 10.0.
