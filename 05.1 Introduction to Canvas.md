# Canvas essentials

To begin, we create a 'canvas' element within the page using the following HTML code:
```html
<canvas id='canvas' width='600' height='300'>
```
If no width and height values are provided, the default dimensions of the canvas will be 300 pixels for the width and 150 pixels for the height.

It is not recommended to declare the dimensions of the canvas using CSS. While it may visually resize the canvas element, it does not change the underlying resolution of the canvas. This can lead to distortion and unexpected results when drawing or interacting with the canvas.

Next, we can add the JavaScript code below, which will print 'Hello Canvas!!' in the center of the canvas:
```javascript
// must be declared after the canvas element
let canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
context = canvas.getContext('2d');

context.font = '30pt sans';
context.fillStyle = '#c0c0c0';
context.strokeStyle = '#505050'

// Calculate the coordinates to center the text
let textX = canvas.width / 2 - 150;
let textY = canvas.height / 2 + 15;

context.fillText('Hello Canvas!!', textX, textY);
context.strokeText('Hello Canvas!!', textX, textY);
```
In the code above, 'canvas.getContext('2d')' retrieves the 2D graphic context of the canvas object. Instead of using fixed numeric values like 'canvas.width/2 - 150' to align the text in the middle of the canvas, it is advisable to calculate the coordinates dynamically for a more flexible approach.

## Canvas element and API

The 'canvas' element API offers only two attributes and three method:

* Canvas attributes:
    * width
    * height
* Canvas methods:
    * **getContext()**: Returns the graphcs context associated with the canvas. Each canvas has one context, and each context is associated with one canvas.
    * **toDataURL(type, quality)**: Returns a data URL that you can assign to the 'src' property of an 'img' element. The first argument specifies the type of image, such as 'image/jpeg' etc. 'image/png' is the defult if you don't specifiy this argument. The second argument is a 'double' value from 0 to 1.0, which specifies a quality level for the image.
    * **toBlob(callback, type, args, ...)**: Creates a 'Blob' that represents a file containing the canvas's image.

## Canvas contexts

The canvas element serves as a container for a context, providing various aspects of graphics such as the 2D context and WebGL, which enables hardware-accelerated 3D rendering.

## Saving and restoring canvas state

CanvasRenderingContext2D maintains a drawing state that can be modified by various methods and properties. In a way, you can think of the CanvasRenderingContext2D as maintaining a state stack. You can save the current state using the save() method, which pushes the current state onto a stack, and later restore it using the restore() method, which pops the top state from the stack and restores the saved state. This allows you to isolate changes to specific parts of the drawing.

By using the save() and restore() methods strategically, you can create a stacking effect where you save a certain state, modify the attributes, perform drawing operations, and then restore the previous state to revert back to its previous settings.
