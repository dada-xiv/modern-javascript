# Drawing 

## 1. The coordinate system

By default, the canvas coordinate system places the origin at the top-left corder of the canvas, with x-axis increasing to the right and y-axis increasing toward the bottom of the canvas. However, you can transfrom the coordinate system by translating or rotating.

## 2. Rectangles

The canvas API provides three methods for rectangles:

* **fillRect(x, y, width, height)** : Fills the specified rectangle with the 'fillSty' attribute. If you specify zero for either the width or height, the method does nothing.
* **strokeRect(x, y, width, height)** : Strokes the specified rectangle, using the attributes 'strokeStyle', 'lineWidth', 'lineJoin' and 'miterLimit'. If you specify zero for either the width or height, it will draw a vertical or horizontal line. The method does nothing if you specify zero for both width and height.
* **clearRect(x, y, width, height)** : Clears the specified rectangle region, which means turning the color to fully transparent black.

If you set context.lineJoin = 'round', then strokeRect() draws a rounded rectangle. To control properties such as the radius of the corner, you must draw those yourself.
